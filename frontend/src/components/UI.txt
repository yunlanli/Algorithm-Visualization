User Interface Components
1. Page Header - Algorithm Visualization
2. canvas
3. Animation Controllers
    - Input field that receives animation parameters
        - Speed of Animation (Element moving speed on canvas)
        - Highlight Speed? (duration of highlight when an element is selected for comparison)
            - This in large determines the overall duration of the animation as
                there are significantly more comparisons than swappings
            - Should this parameter combine with moving speed to form a single parameter?
             Is it better for user to be able to specify this?
        - Array size
            - We will need to specify a maximum length in our program based on the canvas size
        - Canvas size
            - should we instead dynamically changing the canvas size based on user input of 
            array size ? Yes
    - Stop / Pause Animation
4. Type of Algorithm to run
    - display all or use a menu ?
5. Message Component
    Provides an introduction of the algorithm selected. Its routine and analysis of time and 
    space complexity.
6. A Link - Back - that takes the user to the main Page
